This is a program that plays the game wordle. The computer chooses and random word to guess and prompts the user to input
a series of 5-letter word guesses that tells the user how close they are to guessing the word. It matches correct letters
and correct positions by revealing that letter, it uses a "*" to indicate if the letter is in the word to guess, and other-wise
it prints a "_" to indicate the letter in that spot is incorrect. The user gets 6 guesses and handles error checking and 
will tell the user if they won the game or not.
